# Rules of the Game

    The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
    Player 1 starts by placing their symbol (X) in any square on the grid.
    Player 2 (O) then takes their turn, placing their symbol in an empty square on the grid.
    The game continues until one player gets three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
